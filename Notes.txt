Gallery Arrangement Algorithm
=============================
Group images by size
Compile list of slots by size for a large height
while images are left
    of the existing slot types, determine which one has the lowest y index
    insert an image into the gallery list
    remove that slot and any intersecting slots
    if no slots of a type are left but there are images of that type left
        extend the slot lists
