Andrea Notes
============
Homepage - New products should be one row with arrows
put a template image for the banners in my products->z_sitedesign24 folder so i can start working on banners
store - can you do a secondary condition on the price low->high cuz there are alot of things that have the same price. I'd prefer to also see the newest first i think if two items are the same price.
Is this scaling my thumbnails up? is it possible to use upscale for this so they dont look crummy(or is my art just that bad?)

Gallery Arrangement Algorithm
=============================
Group images by size
Compile list of slots by size for a large height
while images are left
    of the existing slot types, determine which one has the lowest y index
    insert an image into the gallery list
    remove that slot and any intersecting slots
    if no slots of a type are left but there are images of that type left
        extend the slot lists

import
