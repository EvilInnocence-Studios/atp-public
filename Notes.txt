Sites Server Locations
============================
EI Server
	amstronaut.com
        - update ambergell.com DNS records
        - setup SSL
    darkwynd
        - issue with @ resolution
        - waiting on dns propagation
	
Testbed
	api.darkwyndchronicles.com
    api.evilinnocence.com
    amstronaut.com, ambergell.com
        - pending
    wholesomehorizons.net
        - pending
	testbed.wittrock.us
	
Oracle
	minecraft.wittrock.us
        - Look into backing up server and hosting locally.

Gallery Arrangement Algorithm
=============================
Group images by size
Compile list of slots by size for a large height
while images are left
    of the existing slot types, determine which one has the lowest y index
    insert an image into the gallery list
    remove that slot and any intersecting slots
    if no slots of a type are left but there are images of that type left
        extend the slot lists
